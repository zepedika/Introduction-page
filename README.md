## Erika Zepeda - Software Engineer & Content Creator
## About Me
Location: Brooklyn, New York

Others create content for pay; I get paid to create content. The difference? My work is driven by a deep-rooted passion for designing and constructing engaging deliverables that make your projects more creative, effective, and efficient.

As a multi-disciplinary content creator based in NYC, I specialize in documentary videography, special effects, and digital photography. I’ve cultivated a reputation for crafting warm, content-focused designs that resonate with a diverse array of clients.

## My Approach
I design with the purpose of helping businesses look more professional, boost sales, and organically grow their audiences. My tenure as a Video and Content Creator for The Actors Theatre Workshop led to an almost 80% increase in viewership.

My work has been showcased in industry publications like the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice WorldLink Reader, and I’ve been recognized by institutions such as The George Washington University, where I received the University and Alumni Award in 2019.

By combining innovation, creativity, and an expert eye for photography, I bring your story to life through powerful visual products.
